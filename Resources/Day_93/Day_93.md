# Day 93

## Description

Day 93 was a second day of LayoutAndGeometry project!

## Tasks

1. Absolute positioning for SwiftUI views. It's really cool to understand how offset and position modifiers are different.
2. Understanding frames and coordinates inside GeometryReader. That's so cool way to learn about frame, absolute and global position.
3. ScrollView effects using GeometryReader. So powerfull effect with simple math!
