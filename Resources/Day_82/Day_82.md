# Day 82

## Description

Day 82 was a fourth day of HotProspects project!

## Tasks

1. Building our tab bar. Clear and simple interface.
2. Sharing data across tabs using @EnvironmentObject. Quite smart usage of EnvironmentObject.
3. Dynamically filtering a SwiftUI List. Lovely implementation of filtering to present different data.
