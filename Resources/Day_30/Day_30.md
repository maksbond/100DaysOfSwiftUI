# Day 30

## Description

Day 30 was second part of a new project - WordScramble!
## Tasks

1. Adding to a list of words. It was simple UI with animation for adding words into array.
2. Running code when our app launches. We added loading of words from our app Bundle and also I used guard with fatalError for app crash in case we can't load words
3. Validating words with UITextChecker. Wow, we finished our 5th app! It was really cool work segregation into smaller methods to make our code clear!
