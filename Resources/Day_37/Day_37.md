# Day 37

## Description

Day 37 was a second part of iExpense project!

## Tasks

1. Building a list we can delete from. Wow, I have just built a simple list in couple minutes!! SwiftUI is cool!
2. Working with Identifiable items in SwiftUI. Quick intro into Identifiable protocol - clean, simple, quick!
3. Sharing an observed object with a new view. @ObservedObject is powerful mechanism to share @StateObject.
4. Making changes permanent with UserDefaults. Interesting way to use UserDefaults to save and read data.
5. Final polish. Quick polish with VStack, HStack, Spacer and @Environment.
