# Day 20

## Description

Day 20 was part one of a new app creation process - Guess the Flag.

## Tasks

1. I downloaded files from [github](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI/project2-files)
2. Using the stacks. Powerfull instrument in SwiftUI.
3. Colors and frames. Good way to customize everything.
4. Gradient. I can't imagine how much it will take to do something similar in regular Swift with UIKit
5. Buttons and images. Straightforward - buttons and images XD
6. Showing alert messages. First big different between UIKit and SwiftUI - we depend on our app state but not show alert.
