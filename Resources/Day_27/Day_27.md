# Day 27

## Description

Day 27 was second part of project 4.

## Tasks

1. Building a basic layout. I build layout with Paul - DatePicker + Steppers + some magic XD
2. Connecting SwiftUI to CoreML. It was easy! I did it once before so nothing new here for me.
3. Cleaning up the user interface. Good example of how quickly change design in couple simple steps.
