# Day 16

## Description

Day 16 was a first part of WeSplit SwiftUI app.

## Tasks

1. Create WeSplit project for SwiftUI app. It was simple and straightforward.
2. Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI App. It was also simple.
3. Creating a form. It was more interesting because it works with Sections and Group.
4. Adding a navigation bar. Unfortunately, this course is not adapted for NavigationStack which apple recommends to use now.
5. Modifying program state. First introduction to properties wrapper @State and real example of access restriction modifiers.
6. Binding state to user interface controls. Understanding of binding in simple manner. Cool and quick lesson.
7. Creating views in a loop. ForEach and usage of id - super cool explanation. Even developers without experience can understand it.
