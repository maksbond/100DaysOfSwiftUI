# Day 57

## Description

Day 57 was a first day of CoreDataProject project!

## Tasks

1. Core Data: Introduction. I created project and completed CoreData setup.
2. Why does \.self work for ForEach? Magic of Hashable protocol :)
3. Creating NSManagedObject subclasses. Ancient magic from Obj-C XD
4. Conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext. hasChanges - cool variable for changes check.
5. Ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints. Cool CoreData feature!
