# Day 43

## Description

Day 43 was a first part of Drawing project!

## Tasks

1. Drawing: Introduction. I created a new project.
2. Creating custom paths with SwiftUI. Path is quite cool mechanism for line drawings.
3. Paths vs shapes in SwiftUI. Shapes are cool! It is simple and accurate solution for different shapes.
4. Adding strokeBorder() support with InsettableShape. Nice lesson with InsettableShape description.
