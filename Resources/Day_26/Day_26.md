# Day 26

## Description

Day 26 was first part of project 4.

## Tasks

1. BetterRest: Introduction. I created project and prepared for other steps.
2. Entering numbers with Stepper. I have never used it before so it was cool a new View element.
3. Selecting dates and times with DatePicker. Same as with Stepper - I have never used it before but I saw it in new design.
4. Working with dates. Nice lesson with valueable lesson - never use adjustments! It is better to use calendar with components.
5. Training a model with Create ML. It is not new tool for me but it still was nice to listen for it.
