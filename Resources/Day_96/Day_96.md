# Day 96

## Description

Day 96 was a first day of SnowSeeker project!

## Tasks

1. SnowSeeker: Introduction. 
2. Working with two side by side views in SwiftUI. Interesting how one Navihation is different for iOS and iPadOS.
3. Using alert() and sheet() with optionals. Looks like optionals works perfectly here.
4. Using groups as transparent layout containers. Looks really good!
5. Making a SwiftUI view searchable. I have never thought that search is so simple in SwiftUI.
