# Day 32

## Description

Day 32 was first day of project 6. We have started Animations!

## Tasks

1. Animation: Intoduction. I created a new project Animations.
2. Creating implicit animation. It was a quick lesson about default implicit animation and how to use them with scale effect and blur.
3. Customizing animations in SwiftUI. Lovely animations with custom effects. I personally was surprised with so easy circle animation.
4. Animating bindings. Good description of value changes animating - we don't change value for animating, we now next expected value but Swift animating changes to this new value.
5. Creating explicit animations. Explicit animation - withAnimation closure block. It is cool that we can do coin animation in couple lines of code.
