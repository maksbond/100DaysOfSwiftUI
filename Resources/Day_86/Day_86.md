# Day 86

## Description

Day 86 was a first day of Flashzilla project!

## Tasks

1. Flashzilla: Introduction. I created Flashzilla app.
2. How to use gestures in SwiftUI. Quite helpful and interesting guide with different gestures.
3. Making vibrations with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator and Core Haptics. Wow, I am really surprised how powerful haptics can be.
4. Disabling user interactivity with allowsHitTesting(). Really cool trick for taps.
