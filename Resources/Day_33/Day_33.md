# Day 33

## Description

Day 33 was second part of project 6. More animations magic!

## Tasks

1. Controlling the animation stack. More information about how modifiers order really matters.
2. Animating gestures. Wow, I am really impressed with such simple code for animations!
3. Showing and hiding views with transitions. Cool transition effects for showing/hidding 
4. Building custom transitions using ViewModifiers. Now, I know how to make custom transition with Custom View Modifier. It was so simple!
