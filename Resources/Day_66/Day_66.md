# Day 66

## Description

Day 66 was a fifth day of Instafilter project!

## Tasks

1. Customizing our filter using confirmationDialog(). It's way better implementation than usage of one filter.
2. Saving the filtered image using UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(). Now, it looks like nice app with filtering function.
