# Day 18

## Description

Day 18 was a third and last part of WeSplit SwiftUI app work.

## Tasks

1. Add a header to the third section. It was easy and straingforward.
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check. Same here - one more computed variable to not duplicated code.
3. Change the tip percentage picker. I changed target again from 15 to 16. I didn't get how to make picker with navigation view on newer Swift with SwiftUI.
4. EXTRA: It was more challenging but I did it!
