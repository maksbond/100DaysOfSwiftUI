# Day 21

## Description

Day 21 was part two of a new app creation process - Guess the Flag.

## Tasks

1. Stacking up buttons. It was a simple and quick prototype.
2. Showing the player's score with an alert. We added some interactivity to our app. I also added our score.
3. Styling our flags. I added styling as was mentioned in challenge but I also made some small improvements.
4. Upgrading our design. We polished everything like in perfect app! I really love it! I added couple updates but I didn't change it too much.
